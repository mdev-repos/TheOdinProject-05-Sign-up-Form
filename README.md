# The Odin Project - Sign-up Form Project (5)

This project is the first of two included in the intermediate HTML and CSS course, first within the JavaScript FullStack developer path.
The creation of a Sign-up form for an imaginary service is requested. The main purpose is to practice creating forms and validating them on the client side.
I hope you like my work :)
